PyTerm is a light-weight Python-based OSS terminal developed by the [NKA Development Team](https://github.com/PyBotDevs), as an alternative to bash, zsh or fish terminals. It is made with os library implementation.

This project is made as a professional terminal which is also easy to use for the general majority of GUI users. (GUI coming soon...) 

## How can I help?
***PLEASE SUBMIT ISSUES AND PULL REQUESTS TO THE REPOSITORY!*** It helps us make our work easier c:

## When can I expect a fully-made version?
When I get a life lol

## When the project's development is complete, what will happen?
Hopefully, if we can finish majority of development for this terminal as a CLI interface, we will also start making some windowed GUI parts of PyTerm for even easier use.
